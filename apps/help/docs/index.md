# Adapterly Documentation

Welcome to Adapterly - the MCP gateway that connects AI agents to your business systems.

> **New to Adapterly?** Start with the [Getting Started Tutorial](/help/en/tutorial/) for a complete introduction.

## Who is Adapterly for?

- **Teams using AI agents** - Give Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor access to your business systems
- **System integrators** - Connect APIs and expose them as MCP tools
- **Enterprises** - Centralize system access with audit logging and project scoping

## Quick Start

1. **Choose adapters** - Select from 70 pre-built system adapters
2. **Configure credentials** - Set up OAuth, API keys, or other auth for each system
3. **Create a project** - Scope which systems and tools are available
4. **Generate API key** - Get an `ak_live_xxx` key for MCP access
5. **Connect AI agent** - Point Claude or any MCP client to the gateway

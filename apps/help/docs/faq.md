# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is Adapterly?
Adapterly is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) gateway that connects AI agents to external business systems. It provides 70 pre-built adapters for construction, logistics, ERP, and general tools, letting AI agents like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor query and manage your data.

### Who is Adapterly for?
- Teams using AI agents who need access to business systems
- System integrators connecting multiple APIs
- Enterprises managing data across platforms with audit and access control
- Construction, logistics, and ERP professionals

### How is Adapterly different from a regular API gateway?
Adapterly speaks the MCP protocol natively. AI agents can discover available tools, understand their parameters, and call them directly. No custom integration code needed - just connect your systems and give the agent an API key.

## Systems

### How do I connect a new system?
1. Go to **Systems** → browse the 70 pre-built adapters
2. Select the system you want
3. Go to **Configure** and enter credentials (API key, OAuth, etc.)
4. Click **Test Connection** - the system becomes "confirmed" after first successful call

### What authentication methods are supported?
- OAuth 2.0 (password grant, client credentials)
- API Key (custom header)
- Bearer Token
- Basic Authentication
- DRF Token (username/password → auto-generated token)
- Session/Cookie (XHR for web apps)

### Why does my connection test fail?
Common causes:
- Incorrect credentials (wrong key, expired token)
- API endpoint is down or unreachable
- Network/firewall restrictions
- Rate limiting from the external API

Check the error message for specific details.

### Can I add a custom system not in the pre-built list?
Yes. Create a YAML adapter definition in `adapters/<industry>/<system>.yaml` and run `python manage.py load_adapters`. See the [Guides](/help/en/guides/) for details.

## MCP & AI Agents

### What is MCP?
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for AI assistants to use external tools. Adapterly acts as an MCP server, giving AI agents access to your connected systems via Streamable HTTP (JSON-RPC 2.0).

### Which AI agents work with Adapterly?
Any MCP-compatible client, including:
- Claude (Desktop and Code)
- ChatGPT (with MCP support)
- Cursor
- Custom agents using MCP libraries

### How do I connect Claude to Adapterly?
1. Generate an API key in MCP Gateway → API Keys
2. Add to your Claude configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "adapterly": {
         "url": "https://adapterly.ai/mcp/v1/",
         "headers": {
           "Authorization": "Bearer ak_live_xxx"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Ask Claude: "What Adapterly tools do you have?"

### What's the difference between Safe and Power mode?
- **Safe mode** (default): Read-only - agents can list and get data but can't create, update, or delete
- **Power mode**: Full access - agents can perform all operations including writes

### Is my data safe with AI access?
- All MCP calls are authenticated via API keys
- Access is controlled by mode, Agent Profile, and project scoping
- Every tool call is logged in the audit log with full details
- You can revoke API keys instantly
- Credentials are stored encrypted

### What can AI agents do vs. what requires manual setup?
AI agents can:
- Read data from configured systems
- Create/update/delete data (with Power mode)
- Query across multiple systems

AI agents cannot:
- Configure new systems or credentials
- Manage API keys or permissions
- Access systems without configured credentials

## Projects

### What are Projects?
Projects are scoped workspaces that control which systems are available to AI agents. Each project has its own set of system integrations and access policies.

### Do I need to create a project?
Projects are optional. If your API key isn't bound to a project, the agent can access all systems in your account. Projects are useful for:
- Restricting access to specific systems per use case
- Organizing integrations by business context
- Applying different permission policies

## Gateway Deployment

### Can I run Adapterly on my own server?
Yes. Adapterly supports a standalone gateway mode (Docker) that runs on your infrastructure. The gateway syncs adapter definitions from the control plane but keeps credentials locally.

### What's the difference between monolith and gateway mode?
- **Monolith**: Everything on one server (Django + FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
- **Control Plane + Gateway**: Central management at adapterly.ai, with standalone gateways on your servers. Credentials stay on the gateway.

### How do I deploy a standalone gateway?
1. Run `docker compose up -d` in the `adapterly-gateway/` directory
2. Open the Setup Wizard at `http://your-host:8080/setup/`
3. Register with the control plane and configure credentials
4. Point your AI agents to `http://your-host:8080/mcp/v1/`

## Account & Team

### How do I add team members?
Go to **Account Settings** → **Invite User** and enter their email address.

### What permissions can team members have?
- **Admin** - Full access including system configuration and API key management
- **User** - View projects and use assigned integrations

## Getting Help

### Where can I report bugs?
Contact support through the application or email support@adapterly.ai.

### Can I request new features or adapters?
Yes! Submit feature requests through the support channel or contribute adapter YAML definitions directly.
